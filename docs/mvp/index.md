# Praeparo MVP

Praeparo turns YAML-defined visuals into automated, Plotly-powered presentations. The minimum viable product (MVP) focuses on validating the developer workflow for defining matrices and generating interactive output without depending on live Power BI connectivity.

## Goals
- Validate the YAML -> Pydantic -> DAX -> Plotly pipeline end-to-end
- Ship an opinionated matrix visual based on `tests/visuals/matrix/auto.yaml`
- Document agent workflow and decision logs so contributions stay aligned
