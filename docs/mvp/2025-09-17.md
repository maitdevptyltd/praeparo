# 2025-09-17 MVP Timeline

## Objectives
- Finalize Pydantic models for matrix configs and generate JSON schema for IDE support.
- Implement template field extraction and draft DAX query builder aligned with matrix needs.
- Produce mock data pipeline and Plotly-based matrix renderer to demonstrate the flow end-to-end.

## Progress
- Planning doc outlines parser, schema, DAX, and renderer components required for the POC.
- Repository structure prepared with `docs/mvp/index.md` and dated timeline to coordinate agent work.

## Blockers
- Awaiting implementation of Mock Power BI data provider and DAX measure registry decisions.
- Styling and publishing workflow requirements still undefined.

## Next Steps
- Build Pydantic model layer and export JSON schema under `schemas/`.
- Wire up YAML loader, field extractor, and mock DAX execution path.
- Draft Plotly renderer using synthetic data and document usage in README.
