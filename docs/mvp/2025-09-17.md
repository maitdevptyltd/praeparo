# 2025-09-17 MVP Timeline

## Objectives
- Finalize Pydantic models for matrix configs and generate JSON schema for IDE support.
- Implement template field extraction and draft DAX query builder aligned with matrix needs.
- Produce mock data pipeline and Plotly-based matrix renderer to demonstrate the flow end-to-end.

## Progress
- Pydantic models and JSON schema exporter established (`schemas/matrix.json` via `python -m praeparo.schema`).
- YAML loader, template field extraction, and DAX query planning implemented with mock dataset generator.
- Plotly table renderer and CLI (`praeparo`) wire the pipeline end-to-end using `tests/matrix/basic/auto.yaml`.
- CLI confirmed to produce Plotly HTML output (`build/auto.html`) alongside generated DAX text.
- Optional PNG snapshots available via `--png-out` (`poetry add kaleido` installs the dependency; now covered by the PNG pipeline test).
- Test suite runs in the Poetry environment (`poetry run pytest`) with syrupy-powered snapshots for DAX plans.

## Blockers
- Awaiting implementation of Mock Power BI data provider and DAX measure registry decisions.
- Styling and publishing workflow requirements still undefined.

## Next Steps
- Harden template evaluation (e.g., context rendering, error messaging) and extend beyond matrix visuals.
- Replace mock data provider with real DAX execution integration when backend details are available.
- Layer in styling/theming controls and PPTX export once visualization defaults are approved.
